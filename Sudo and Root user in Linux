### Sud AND Root user 

Sudo 

1)sudo -i : login as root user 
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ sudo -i
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~#
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~# pwd
/root

2)exit : logout as root user to the previous directory 
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~# exit
logout
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$

3)vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ sudo -i
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~# cat /etc/shadow

with root user you can open the privelegaed files 


Hidden file 

There’s nothing special about a hidden file or folder, other than it’s name: simply starting a name with a dot (”.”) is enough to make it disappear.
