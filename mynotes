My notes :

File system Structure and commands

•	Changing password : passwd userid
•	Linux file system is just like windows file system however the root / is the first directory of Hard disk and just like in windows it’s the C 
The subfolders in C which are predefined when you install the OS, similar to that Linux also have predefined folders /etc    /home    /bin 
This commands below will show you the home directory and its contents 
1.	Cd /
2.	Ls -l 
/Bin 	Directory that have all the linux commands
/boot	Contains file that are not used by linux OS but used only by the bootloader
/etc 	Any configuration changes ,additional Programs and data files 
/mnt 	Is used for mounting network shared file system such as NFS CIFS and Samba
/opt	Optional addon applications  
/root	Root home directory not same as /
/sbin	System binaries
/proc	Running processes
/tem	Temporary directory
/home 	User directories
/var	Directory for system logs
/run	Companion directory for /var/run
/dev	Contains refereneces to all the peripheral hardware
/media	cdrom

•	Navigating File system 
Cd	Change directory
Pwd	Present working directory 
Ls	List
cd..	One step back
Su - 	Root user
Touch file name
Cp target file name new name
vi 	
Creating /copy files
Mkdir	Make directory 

Mv	Move 
Ls – ltr	List items in the order they are created
find



locate	Find . -name “file name or any key term you searching for “
Example : find / .name “ifcfgenp0s3”
 
locate filename


•	Wildcards 
A wildcard is a character that can be  used as a substitute for any of the class of  characters in search
•	* (star or astring) is used to represent 0 or more characters
•	? represents single charaacter
•	[] can be used to create a grup of files 
•	\ (backslash) as an escape character 
•	^(carat) beginging of the line 
•	$ (Dollar ) end of the line 


Examples of usage of wildcards

1.	If you want to create multiple files at the same time in a pattern 
Like example : abcd1-xyz ,abcd2-xyz ,abcd3-xyz etc upto like 10 or 20 or 1000 then you need to use
Command : touch filename{ inside curly braces start number dotdot..end number } like below :
touch abcd{1..9}-xyz

2.	now suppose you want to remove the files you created and you know the pattern or names of the files you have created which are saved in different locations , now you cannot go to all directories and delete all by searching each folder or directory instead 
                            rm abcd*  or u can also type  rm *xyz
so now the * will search all the files in all directories with filenames starting from abcd or ending with xyz and then they will be deleted.
3.	For ? 
ls-l  ?bcd*
will list the files which have bcd in it
4.	For []    
ls -l *[cd]*
will list all the filed which will have cd in it no matter what the before and after letters are










Linux Administration 

•	Pipe command (|) it connects two commands 
Example : command1 arguments | command2 arguments
		ls-l |more 
more command shows one page at a time in list of pages
		ls-l |tail -l
tail will show the last line of the page 

•	File permissions 
There are three permissions in the 
 r is read
 wis write 
x is execute

•	the permissions are given to following categories 
user 
group 
other   

•	now if you see the file name in the linux like -rwxrwxrwx
first bit – represents what type of file is this If its -rwxrwxrwx  it can directory(starts with D) link (starts with L) or regular file (starts with -).
Next three bits rwx in -rwxrwxrwx that the user permissions in this is read write execute 
Next three bits rwx in -rwxrwxrwx that the group  permissions in this is read write execute 
Next three bits rwx in -rwxrwxrwx that the other permissions in this is read write execute 

•	change mode –
command -chmod 
like if you want to remove the group permissions of a file to read and write only then 

chmod g-x filename 
this above command will change group permissions modification to -rwxrw-rwx

now suppose you want to change the other permissions to read and write only then 
chmod a-x filename
this above commnd will change other to all permissions modification to -rwxrw-rw-

chmod can not only remove but also give the permissions 

now suppose you want to give the other permissions to read write and execute then 
chmod a+x filename
this above commnd will change other to all permissions modification to -rwxrw-rwx

•	chown and chgrp

chown command is used to change the ownership of the file in user column 
chgrp changes the ownership of the file in group section 

like example
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls -ltr
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    0 Aug 28 14:05 second                                                                                         Note : ( vagrant in red is user vagrant in blue is group)
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    0 Aug 28 14:05 first
drwxrwxr-x 2 vagrant vagrant 4096 Aug 28 15:46 FDire
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ chown root FDire
drwxrwxr-x 2 root vagrant 4096 Aug 28 15:46 FDire
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ chgrp root FDire
drwxrwxr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 28 15:46 FDire

Adding Text to files 

Three ways to type the text to files
	Vi 
	Redirects :  > (write ) and >>(append)
	Echo
And additional cat command

Examples :

	> command &  >> command 
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls
FDire  first  second
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ echo you have the first statement
you have the first statement
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ echo you have the first statement > First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cat First
you have the first statement
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ echo you have the second statement >> First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cat First
you have the first statement
you have the second statement




	Command   > will erase everything and write fresh 
Where as >> will add or append to existing 

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls -l
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 2 vagrant vagrant 4096 Aug 28 15:46 FDire
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    0 Aug 28 14:05 first
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   59 Aug 28 16:38 First
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    0 Aug 28 14:05 second
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ echo now this will erase existing and you will see this statement only > First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cat First
now this will erase existing and you will see this statement only
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$


FILE Maintenance commands

Cp                  this copies the file 
                       Example :
  vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cp First first
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cat First
now this will erase existing and you will see this statement only
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cat first
now this will erase existing and you will see this statement only
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
Mv                 this moves the file
Example:
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ mv second FDire
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ pwd
/home/vagrant
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls
FDire  first  First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cd FDire
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ ls
second
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$
Rm : remove the file
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ rm second
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ ls
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ pwd
/home/vagrant/FDire
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ ls
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$
Mkdir : it created the directory 

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ mkdir funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cd funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/funwork$ touch F{1..5}abc
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/funwork$ ls
F1abc  F2abc  F3abc  F4abc  F5abc
Rmdir or rm – r     removes the directory  and rm – r removes all the files as well inside the directory completely rm – r (r stands for recursive delete)
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/FDire$ cd
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ rmdir FDire
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls
first  First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$

rm – r 
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ mkdir funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cd funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/funwork$ touch F{1..5}abc
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/funwork$ ls
F1abc  F2abc  F3abc  F4abc  F5abc
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/funwork$ cd ..
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls
first  First  funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ rmdir funwork
rmdir: failed to remove ‘funwork’: Directory not empty   (#since it has files !!!)
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ rm -r funwork
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls
first  First
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
Chgrp
